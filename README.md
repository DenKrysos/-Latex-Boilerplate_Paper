# -Latex-Boilerplate_Paper

A quite nice Boilerplate/Template together with some Macros and ready-to-use set up surroundings for LaTeX. Document-Type "Article-Level", i.e. no "Book".

* Layout and Skeleton Setup is well separated from the content
* Set up for Biblatex
* Set up for glossaries (requires external builder, pretty easy to configure)
* All the layout regarding stuff is inside "0organization"
  * There mostly only thing has to be touched: Choose your prefered Author-Format (different Files for different Formats) and also write the correct Authors themselves there
* "2ProjectSetup.tex" has some Makros set-up to unify directory-references. For easy use, just leave it as is and use the Macros when e.g. including files out of the set folders.
* The structuring of your Project Skeleton starts from "3Disposition.tex". The rest happens inside the directory "4chapter".
  * I suggest to just leave "3Disposition.tex" as is and work inside "4chapter". But if you prefer, changing "3Disposition.tex" is fine as well.


## Some Feature:
* Macro to automatically include a "standalone tikz picture" with the best options.
  * Ensures, that the picture does not exceed the page/environment size on any side
  * Allows several options, like rotate, crop, insert as plain-text (render together with main file) or as pre-rendered pdf-picture.
  * If desired the pictures can be included as "buildnew". Means: They are only rendered new, if they changed. Saves a lot of compilation time.
  * Allows explicit scaling and positioning
* tikz:
  * Some 3-Dimensional Graphic Generation done in tikz
  * Flow Graph Toolset

* For sure some more features I can't quite recall. That thing is huge...
