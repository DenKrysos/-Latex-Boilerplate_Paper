% Titles are generally capitalized except for words such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or last word of the title. Linebreaks \\ can be used within to get better formatting as desired. Do not put math or special symbols in the title.
